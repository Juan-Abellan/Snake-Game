<h1>Snake-Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.<br>

In order to recreate this game we develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Turtle graphics. For this project we also use OOP concepts in order to define the different classes needed for the game. The random module is part of the game defining the random locations for the blue dot (food for the snake).<br>

The scoreboard class has a function reset_max() which updates the score board each time the players reaches a new record.
